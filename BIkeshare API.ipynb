    "# Introduction\n",
    "In most cases when we are running a business, there are a lot of data stakeholder outside our company. The problem is that we need to provide the access in a way that they will not break our security rules or concerns. One way to solve that is by creating an API for the database. In this project, we will introduce you on how python is used for data transaction management using Flask API. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Usecase**: Bikeshare App\\\n",
    "Have you ever rent a bike for faster mobility in town? In the past few years, this business once become a phenomenom. In Indonesia, there are lots of similar services, for example, the Jakarta government's \"GOWES\" bike sharing service that launcehd in July 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the user perspective, the general journey is denoted as follows:\n",
    "- User scan the bike located at some bike station, sending the data to database as the intent of \"start riding\"\n",
    "- Once user has reached its destination station, he/she put back the bike, sending the data again to the database as the intent of \"finished riding\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For each activity, there are data transactions between user and database. And how do you think each user's phone communicate with the server for storing and receiving the data? Using API ofcourse! \n",
    "\n",
    "We will later create a simplified version of the API service which handles data transactions and analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals**: Make an API service to connect 3rd party user with data using HTTP request\n",
    "\n",
    "**End Product**: A Flask API which capable of doing: \n",
    "- Input new data to database\n",
    "- Read specific data from database\n",
    "- Get specific insight from data analysis process (ie: best performing stations)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring Metrics**: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. 1 point - Created Flask App\n",
    "2. 2 poitns - Created functionality to read or get specific data from the databse\n",
    "3. 4 points - Created functionality to input new data into each table for the databases\n",
    "4. 3 points - Created static endpoints which return analytical result (must be different from point 2,3)\n",
    "5. 3 points - Created dynamic endpoints which return analytical result (must be different from point 2,3,4)\n",
    "6. 3 points - Created POST endpoint which receive input data, then utilize it to get analytical result (must be different from point 2,3,4,5)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools**: \n",
    "- **Python** with **Jupyter Notebook**, installed with **required libraries**\n",
    "- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: Recommended for writing application scripts\n",
    "- **TablePlus**: Recommended for easy database access and exploration\n",
    "- Postman: Optional for easy API testing\n"
